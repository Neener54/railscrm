Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.\r\n\r\nRails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS.  I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite.  I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.  Rails CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of features that are not yet implemented and I will add them to the Pivotal Tracker https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421.\r\n\r\nThere is also a live version on Heroku at http://demo.railscrm.com\r\n\r\n\r\nMongodb\r\n=======\r\n\r\nRails CRM uses Mongodb for its database.  You will need to have it installed to use Rails CRM.  To install mongocrm, checkout the Mongodb installation information at: \r\n\t\r\n\thttp://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/\r\n\r\nRVM\r\n===\r\n\r\nRails CRM has a .rvmrc file for specifying the Ruby version.  If you are not using RVM you should.  RVM can be installed at the command line using:\r\n\r\n\tcurl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\t1.  git clone the repository\r\n\t2.  cd into rails_crm\r\n\t3.  accept the .rvmrc file\r\n\t4.  gem install bundler\r\n\t5.  bundle install\r\n\r\nStart rails server and go to localhost:3000 and you will see the Rails CRM login page.  Just create a user and you are up and running.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Flow\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThis is the intended workflow:\r\n\r\n\t1. Create a Lead\r\n\t2. Create a Task for a Lead\r\n\t3. Convert Lead\r\n\t\t3.1 After qualifying a lead it can be converted to to contact\r\n\t\t3.2 During the conversion process, an Opportunity can be created\r\n\t4. Create a Contact \r\n\t\t4.1 These do NOT have to be a converted lead\r\n\t5. Create an Account\r\n\t\t5.1 An account can have many contacts and is generally the Company\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial setup will require Users to be created.  Once your Organization has Users, it can assign leads, contacts, opportunities and accounts to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb-to-Lead\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThanks to Rahul, Rails CRM now has a web-to-lead function.  With this, you can generate a web-to-lead form to put on your website which will create a new lead in Rails CRM when a visitor submits the form.\r\n\r\nWhen you go to Leads and click on Web-to-Lead it brings up the form generator.  \r\n\r\nRedirect URL - This is the page that you want to redirect to after the form is submitted.  This is most likely the \"Thank You\" page.\r\n\r\nForm Creation - Select the fields that you want your form to have.  At this time we do not have the ability to add a custom field so WYSIWYG.  After selecting the fields, click \"Generate Form\" and this will bring you to the generated form code.  Copy and paste this code on your website.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n====\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stories in Pivotal Tracker, the following still need to be done:\r\n\r\n\t1. Create User dashboard\r\n\t\t1.1 This will include views for user's leads and tasks.  Leads assigned to user needs to be sortable by several fields such as Name, Company, Status, Date Created, etc.  \r\n\t\t1.2 A sidebar on the dashboard for quick create links for lead, task, contact.\tThe side bar should also have a search field for searching all all of the categories.\r\n\t2.\tAdd tagging to Leads and Opportuntites.\r\n\t3.  Create Import/Export process.\r\n\t4.\tCreate standard reports TBD.\r\n\r\nUltimately, RailsCRM needs to remain easy to set up and to use and not become bloated like so many other CRM's out there.\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nIf you make improvements to this application, please share with others.\r\n\r\nSend the author a message, create an [issue](https://github.com/brobertsaz/railscrm/issues), or fork the project and submit a pull request.\r\n\r\nIf you add functionality to this application, create an alternative implementation, or build an application that is similar, please contact me and Iâ€™ll add a note to the README so that others can find your work.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, so if you would like to help out or have suggestions, feel free to contact me at bob@rebel-outpost.com\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2012 Bob Roberts <bob@rebel-outpost.com>\r\nDistributed under the MIT license.\r\nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Ruby on Rails CRM with Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap and Devise"}
