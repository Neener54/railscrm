        <h1><strong>Rails CRM</strong></h1>

<p>Rails CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application.  Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.</p>

<p>Rails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS.  I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite.  I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.  Rails CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features that are not yet implemented and I will add them to the Pivotal Tracker <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421">https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a live version on Heroku at <a href="http://demo.railscrm.com">http://demo.railscrm.com</a></p>

<h1>Mongodb</h1>

<p>Rails CRM uses Mongodb for its database.  You will need to have it installed to use Rails CRM.  To install mongocrm, checkout the Mongodb installation information at: </p>

<pre><code>    http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
</code></pre>

<h1>RVM</h1>

<p>Rails CRM has a .rvmrc file for specifying the Ruby version.  If you are not using RVM you should.  RVM can be installed at the command line using:</p>

<pre><code>    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</code></pre>

<h1>Install</h1>

<pre><code>1.  git clone the repository
2.  cd into rails_crm
3.  accept the .rvmrc file
4.  gem install bundler
5.  bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>Start rails server and go to localhost:3000 and you will see the Rails CRM login page.  Just create a user and you are up and running.</p>

<h1>Approval Process</h1>

<p>As the default, all users are automatically approved upon registration.  To change this just edit line 12 of the user model:</p>

<pre><code>  field :approved, :type =&gt; Boolean, :default =&gt; true ## change to false
</code></pre>

<h1>Work Flow</h1>

<p>This is the intended workflow:</p>

<pre><code>1. Create a Lead
2. Create a Task for a Lead
3. Convert Lead
    3.1 After qualifying a lead it can be converted to to contact
    3.2 During the conversion process, an Opportunity can be created
4. Create a Contact 
    4.1 These do NOT have to be a converted lead
5. Create an Account
    5.1 An account can have many contacts and is generally the Company
</code></pre>

<p>The initial setup will require Users to be created.  Once your Organization has Users, it can assign leads, contacts, opportunities and accounts to them.</p>

<h1>Web-to-Lead</h1>

<p>Thanks to Rahul, Rails CRM now has a web-to-lead function.  With this, you can generate a web-to-lead form to put on your website which will create a new lead in Rails CRM when a visitor submits the form.</p>

<p>When you go to Leads and click on Web-to-Lead it brings up the form generator.  </p>

<p>Redirect URL - This is the page that you want to redirect to after the form is submitted.  This is most likely the "Thank You" page.</p>

<p>Form Creation - Select the fields that you want your form to have.  At this time we do not have the ability to add a custom field so WYSIWYG.  After selecting the fields, click "Generate Form" and this will bring you to the generated form code.  Copy and paste this code on your website.</p>

<h1>TODO</h1>

<p>In addition to the stories in Pivotal Tracker, the following still need to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create links to show views</li>
<li>Add email function to leads/contacts etc (click to email)</li>
<li>  Add tagging to Leads and Opportuntites.</li>
<li>Create Import/Export process.</li>
<li>Create standard reports TBD.</li>
</ul><p>Ultimately, RailsCRM needs to remain easy to set up and to use and not become bloated like so many other CRM's out there.</p>
