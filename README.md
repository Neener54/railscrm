Rails Mongo CRM
===============

Rails Mongo CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application.  Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails Mongo CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.

Rails Mongo CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS.  I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite.  I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.  Rails Mongo CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.

There are a lot of features that are not yet implemented and I will add them to the Pivotal Tracker https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421.

There is also a live version on Heroku at http://mongocrm.herokuapp.com/

This is a work in progress, so if you would like to help out or have suggestions, feel free to contact me at bob@rebel-outpost.com
