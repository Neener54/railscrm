          <h1>Rails Mongo CRM</h1>

<p>Rails Mongo CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application.  Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails Mongo CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.</p>

<p>Rails Mongo CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS.  I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite.  I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.  Rails Mongo CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features that are not yet implemented and I will add them to the Pivotal Tracker <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421">https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/503421</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a live version on Heroku at <a href="http://mongocrm.herokuapp.com/">http://mongocrm.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<p>This is a work in progress, so if you would like to help out or have suggestions, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:bob@rebel-outpost.com">bob@rebel-outpost.com</a> </p>

<h1>Install</h1>

<pre><code>gem install bundler
bundle install
</code></pre>

<h1>Work Flow</h1>

<p>This is the intended workflow:</p>

<pre><code>1. Create a Lead
2. Create a Task for a Lead
3. Convert Lead
    3.1 After qualifying a lead it can be converted to to contact
    3.2 During the conversion process, an Opportunity can be created
4. Create a Contact 
    4.1 These do NOT have to be a converted lead
5. Create an Account
    5.1 An account can have many contacts and is generally the Company
</code></pre>

<p>The initial setup will require Users to be created.  Once your Organization has Users, it can assign leads, contacts, opportunities and accounts to them.</p>
